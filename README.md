# Work Day Scheduler
## Description
- This work scheduler helps us visualize and organize tasks in our wok day by the hour so we can stay productive and see at a glance what we need to get done and how much time we have to do so.
- To build this project, I first started with bootstrap for the layout and then used moment.js for the time. I ran the time through some if/else statements and then worked on allowing the user to edit and save tasks to their local storage so that they can be accessed on reload.
- I ran into some problems with the hours and in the future I would like to change the logic I used to check and change the hour colors but I am happy with how everything turned out in the time that I had.
